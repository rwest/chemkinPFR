This is based on the Chemkin example that is installed on MIT's athena at 
/afs/athena.mit.edu/software/chemkin_v4.1.1/distrib/samples/sample_apps_cpp/conp

Files conp_make.inc and conp_unix.mak have been modified to allow users
to compile the conp example outside the CHEMKIN software tree which is
read-only to users. You also need to use g77 as FORTRAN compiler, as gfortran
is incompatible with CHEMKIN for some reason. A suitable 32 bit g77 is in the
gcc-3.4 locker. You will most likely need to install your own 64 bit g77
for 64 bit Linux; a 3.4.x release will most likely work best.

To run this example on 32-bit linux Athena:

add chemkin
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/athena/bin:/afs/athena.mit.edu/software/chemkin_v4.1.1/distrib/chemkin41_linux9/bin
setenv PATH ".:$PATH"
add -f gcc-3.4 
make



Although the gcc part only works on Linux-32, here are the chemkin paths for 
other Athena systems.
Linux 32:
/mit/chemkin_v4.1.1/lib
/afs/athena.mit.edu/software/chemkin_v4.1.1/distrib/chemkin41_linux9/bin 

Linux 64:
/mit/chemkin_v4.1.1/lib
/mit/chemkin_v4.1.1/distrib/chemkin41_linuxx8664/bin 

Sun:
/afs/athena.mit.edu/software/chemkin_v4.1.1/distrib/chemkin41_sun/bin
/mit/sunsoft_v12/SUNWspro/libdynamic/v9
